# SaveYourCity
A simple game that shows how we destroy our environment and its destructions consequences.
Our goal is to send the people the following message:
"Save our planet, save yourself, save your children and make this earth a better place to live for everyone.

A lot of people, most of us, play video games. That´s why we decided to create a game based on the issue of climate change. But how were we
supposed to do that?

So here´s our game explained:
  There are two cities fighting each other by building factories and facilities either harming or cleaning up the environment.
  Every player can decide what to build or to do next, depending on his own will or creativity.
